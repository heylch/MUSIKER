# Welcome to Chuhan Liu Web Development Home Page
My name is Chuhan Liu. I'm a graduate student in computer science in Northeastern University. Previously, I majored in 
Electronic and Computer Engineering during my undergraduate study. I have much interest in web development. I'm looking
forward to making a fantastic home page for myself and other useful websites for public after complete cs5610.

The repository is used for helping TAs and instructor get easy access to my work, so that they can check my code and grade my assigmentss/project.
